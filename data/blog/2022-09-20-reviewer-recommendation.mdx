[//]: # 'Imagine you have an active and popular open source project on Github. Many contributors have contributed to it, and there are many open pull requests.'
[//]: # "How would you handle this situation? If you don't respond to a pull request quickly, you risk losing contributors, so in order to speed up your software development and improve the software quality, you should find potential reviewers for each pull request."

In this article, we will analyze social relation between contributors and reviewers in [Github](https://github.com/), and create a social network to recommend reviewers for pull requests.

_All the code from this article is available [here](https://github.com/miladbarzideh/reviewer-recommendation)_.

## Analyze code contributions

[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) is an open-source machine learning framework. Currently, it has more than 3000 contributors and 225 open pull requests.
To analyze its data, we use [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve the history of closed pull requests for the last 10 pages.

```python
from github import Github

# Specify your own Github access token here
client = Github('ACCESS_TOKEN', per_page=100)
user = client.get_user('tensorflow')
repo = user.get_repo('tensorflow')
# Get pull requests by query [PaginatedList]
pull_requests = repo.get_pulls(state='closed', sort="created", direction="desc")
```

We create the following dataset based on the review comments in each pull request, which includes 177 pull requests and 1217 comments.

| pull_request_id | contributor | pull_request_created_at | reviewer | review_comment_created_at |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 55236           | gzmkl       | 2022-03-15 04:03:12     | penpornk | 2022-03-23 20:49:21       |
| 55236           | gzmkl       | 2022-03-15 04:03:12     | gzmkl    | 2022-03-24 22:43:48       |

According to the data, it takes `9 days` for a pull request to get its first review.
Imagine we want to speed up this process and assign potential reviewers for new pull requests with [mention](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) tool.
A pull request may come from a familiar contributor or a new contributor. Therefore, we consider these two simple rules for finding reviewers:

1. We find those who have previously interacted with the familiar contributors
2. We find most active reviewers in different communities for new contributors

## Create social network

We use [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) to create the structure of the social network.
If node V<sub>j</sub> has reviewed at least one of V<sub>i</sub>â€™s
pull-requests, there is an edge E<sub>ij</sub> from V<sub>i</sub> to V<sub>j</sub>.

![comment network](/static/blogs/2022-09-20-reviewer-recommendation/simple-graph.png)

Each edge has a weight that shows the importance of the edge and is calculated based on the following hypotheses:

- The comments in multiple pull-requests are more important than those
  in one pull-request
- The new comments are more important than old ones

As a result, reviewers who have interacted with a contributor more recently are considered more important and have a higher weight.

_Details of the weight formula can be found here[^1]_.

$$
W_{ij} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{w(r,j,i)} = \sum_{r=1}^{k}\sum_{n=1}^{m}{\lambda^{n-1}} \times t_{(ij,r,n)}
$$

```python
import networkx as nx

weight_matrix = calculate_weight_matrix(df_train)

G = nx.DiGraph()

for contributor in weight_matrix.keys():
    for reviewer in weight_matrix[contributor].keys():
        G.add_edge(contributor, reviewer, weight=weight_matrix[contributor][reviewer])
```

## Community detection

In [complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network), a network is said to have a `community structure` if its nodes can be easily grouped into sets of densely connected components.
Nodes in each group usually have common interests. In our example, nodes (developers) may collaborate on a part of the project with a specific logic or technology, therefore, we can recommend active reviewers from these communities.
We use [girvan-newman](https://networkx.guide/algorithms/community-detection/girvan-newman/) algorithm to identify communities. In the image, different colors indicate different communities.

```python
from networkx.algorithms.community.centrality import girvan_newman

# https://networkx.guide/algorithms/community-detection/girvan-newman/
communities = girvan_newman(G)
```

## Reviewer recommendation

We split our data to train and test sets to validate our model.

```python
msk = np.random.rand(len(df)) < 0.8
df_train = df[msk]
df_test = df[~msk]
```

It makes sense to recommend `k` reviewers for a pull request (Top-K recommendation). To evaluate our model, we use [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) as classical evaluation metrics. The table below shows the results for various values of k.

| k   | Precision | Recall |
| --- | --------- | ------ |
| 4   | 0.57      | 0.90   |
| 3   | 0.57      | 0.89   |
| 2   | 0.59      | 0.81   |
| 1   | 0.75      | 0.69   |
