In this article, we'll learn about the inverted index and how it helps Elasticsearch to search documents faster than other NoSQL databases.

## Introduction

Suppose you want to know which poems of [Hafez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez) have words `زُلف` and `شب` (boolean retrieval). How will you do that?
One way is to use the Unix command `grep` and do a linear search through all documents (poems). This is an effective way, especially with modern computers.
But for several reasons, we need more effective ways:

- To process large documents quickly: There are many online document collections that are growing rapidly, and we need to search these collections.
- Other operation: e.g. find the word (`چرخ` near `مراد`) not feasible.
- To allow ranked retrieval: We sometimes need more relevant documents, and we like to rank them.

The best way to meet our requirements is to `index` the documents in advance.

## Inverted index

The `inverted index` is a data structure used for full-text searches. It keeps a dictionary of words (terms), and for each word, it has a list that records which documents this word occurs in (postings list).
The basic idea of this data structure is shown below:

![Inverted index](/static/blogs/2023-01-26-how-elasticsearch-indexes-documents/inverted-index.png)

In order to take advantage of the inverted index in retrieval time, we need to build it in advance. The steps for building the inverted index are:

- Collect the documents to be indexed.
- Tokenization: turning each document into a list of tokens
- Normalization: producing a list of normalized tokens
- Index the documents

There are different types of digital documents (PDF, XML, ...) with different file encodings (UTF-8, ASCII).
The first step of processing is to convert these documents into a linear sequence of characters. Then, each document needs to be tokenized. We also normalize tokens to deal with the complexity of languages.
Tokenization and normalization are beyond the scope of this article.
You can find more information on this topic here[^1]. However, here we only mention a few techniques used in text data preprocessing.

- Case folding: Reduce all letters to lowercase
- Dropping stop words (common words): e.g. a, an, and
- Lemmatization: Reduce variant form to base form
- Stemming: Reduce a word to its stem

The sequence of terms in each document, tagged by their document ID is grouped together. As a result, we have a dictionary that stores the terms and has a pointer to the documents list (postings list) for each term.
it's common to store other useful information such as term frequency (the frequency of each term in each document) or the position(s) of the term in each document in the postings list.

Let's go back to our first question: `زُلف` and `شب`. To find the answer to this query using the inverted index, we follow these steps:

- Locate `زُلف` in the dictionary and retrieve its postings list
- Locate `شب` in the dictionary and retrieve its postings list
- Intersect the two postings list and return it to the user

`Elasticsearch` uses the inverted index to store documents[^2]:

> Elasticsearch uses a data structure called an inverted index that supports very fast full-text searches. An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in.

## Ranked retrieval

When using Boolean queries, the number of matching documents may exceed the number that can be handled by a human user.
Accordingly, it is essential for a search engine to rank the matching documents based on their relevance to the query.
To do this, a score is calculated for each matching document with respect to the query at hand.
This ranking allows us to show only the top k results to users. There are two main factors that determine a document's score:

- Term frequency ($tf_{t,d}$): The number of times that a term occurs in a document, and the more times a term occurs in a document, the more relevant that document is.
- Inverse document frequency ($idf_t$): This is a measure of the informativeness of a term. Frequent terms are less informative than rare terms

Based on these factors, we can score the documents with the following formula (the log dampens the effect of IDF):

$$
tf{-}idf_{t,d} = tf_{t,d} \times idf_t = (1 + \log_{10} tf_{t,d}) \times (log_{10} \frac{N}{df_t})
$$

`Elasticsearch` also uses these factors to score documents in its ranking algorithm called [BM25](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables)[^3]. It provides an explain query parameter to understand how the score is calculated:

```json
GET index_name/_search
{
  "explain": true,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "content": {
        "query": "inverted index"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at the inverted index and discussed how this data structure helps us retrieve documents more quickly, and the important factors used to rank retrieval.
If you're interested in learning more about this topic and building something with these concepts, try looking at [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) and building a simple search engine.
